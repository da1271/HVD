    <h1>Happy Valentines!!</h1>
<p>  Hi Grace.. I bet you were thinking that I didnt do anything again for valentines day right?? LOL YOU ARE WRONG
  THIS TIME. I was thinking about giving you the letter before you left, but I thought it would be a better idea
  to make a website for you (: because you know, you said you enjoy things that I have never done for anyone and I am
  100 percent sure that I have never made a website for someone on valentines day. I hope no one has made one for you..
  Grace, in your letter you say I have changed a lot for you.. which is very true I did change a lot but I dont
  consider it me changing, but me learning very important life essentials from you and making myself a better overall
  person. I have learned to be more open-minded.. I learned to take off the ignorance goggles and look at the world in
  a much wider and better perspective. I have also learned that loving someone just deep inside and not doing anything
  for that person on the outter is definitely a no-go LMAO.. I realize that small things like making a website, ordering
  food for each other half way across the country are factors that affect how we feel and love each other as well.
  You infact motivate me to be more productive throughout the day (I was shocked at how crazy your work schedule was
  during sophomore year when I basically didnt do shit LMAO). I'm sure there are many more things that you have influenced
  me throughout our relationship and I thank you for every single one of them.. I mean it (: We do not know what the
  future holds, but I am willing to take on this adventure together, continuing to grow and learn from each other. When
  I say that "you are the best thing to ever happen to me", I hope you know that I actually really mean it.. I know we
  are not together in the same place, but I hope we both learn something from this time apart from each other as well..
  Missing you everyday, thinking about you, imagining you next to me, yea it all sucks that I cant see you but I feel like
  the more I miss you I appreciate you more when I am next to you. I promise that I will return ASAP when all of this is
  over.. Have a lovely day my love, -Doyle
